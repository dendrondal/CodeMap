# CodeMap

CodeMap is a command-line tool that allows you to visualize all the local import statnments within a Python repository, giving you a high-level view of a project structure. CodeMap was inspired by the work of [Mike Bostock]() and [Code Flower](), which accomplish a similar need for JavaScript (the second is platform-agnostic). CodeMap uses Chord diagrams to interactively view repository structure.
